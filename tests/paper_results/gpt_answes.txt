Manufacturing Answer: 
```python
manufacturing_processes = {
    "Turning": "Used for creating the cylindrical shape of the part, including the outer diameters and chamfers.",
    "Drilling/Boring": "To achieve the internal diameter and the countersink specified in section A-A.",
    "Milling": "For creating the flat surfaces if needed, and refining any features not achievable by turning.",
    "Reaming": "To ensure the internal diameter of Ø21.5±0.1 is precise and smooth.",
    "Grinding": "To achieve the surface finish required on precise diameters, such as Ø38 H12.",
    "Deburring": "To break all sharp edges and remove burrs as specified in the drawing notes.",
}
```

Quality Control Answer:
